## Description

A Tool which is integrating the Power of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a simple CLI.

### How does it work?

Calls can be made to OpenAI's ChatGPT with an API-Key or also to Ollama which runs locally.
The program also supports Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which means the models can be enriched with your own data.
Currently the tool is based on the OpenAI API and llamaindex for the RAG.
